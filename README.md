# httpServer

This project was developed to support the google maps application. It has two purposes one is process the World CIA Fact book and chop this up into multiple files one per country taking just the information needed by the front end.

The other was to support the front end with an API to retrieve a list of the countries and to return information about a single country.

# Installation

1. From the command line run git clone https://github.com/markp112/httpServer.git
2. Once the package has cloned type yarn install
3. to run the application type node server the application will start on port 8085.

The application is not intended to be used stand alone, however it can be used to split the CIA factbook into a file per country caontaining the summary information, latitude and longitude and land mass.
